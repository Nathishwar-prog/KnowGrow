# 📂 Blog Folder Guidelines

## 📝 Purpose
This folder contains all files and resources related to the **blog section** of the project, including:
- Blog post content
- Blog templates
- Blog-related scripts and styles

---

## 📁 File Organization
1. Separate files by **type**:
   - `posts/` — markdown or HTML files for individual blog posts  
   - `templates/` — layout templates for blog pages  
   - `assets/` — images, styles, or scripts specific to blog posts
2. Use **clear folder structure** to keep content easy to find and maintain.

---

## ⚠️ Valid Files Only
- Store only **blog-related** files in this folder.
- Do **not** store unrelated assets or code.

---

## ✍️ Content Guidelines
1. Blog post files should follow **approved format** (e.g., `.md` or `.html`).
2. Include metadata (title, author, date, tags) at the start of each post.
3. Use optimized images — compress before upload.

---

## 📌 Naming Convention
- Use **lowercase filenames** with hyphens for spaces.  
  Example:  
  - `introduction-to-ai.md`  
  - `web-development-trends-2025.md`
- For images:  
  - `blog-title-keyword.jpg`

---

## ♻️ Version Control & Edits
1. Do not delete posts without explicit permission.
2. For content updates, keep old versions unless removal is approved.
3. Clearly describe changes in commit messages.
